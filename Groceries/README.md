## How to run it ##

Clone the project using `git clone` command:

```bash
~$ git clone git@github.com:francisrod01/nativescript-angular2-first-app.git
```

Navigate to the `Groceries` folder:

```bash
~$ cd Groceries/
```

Install the node dependencies that you need to run this project on your device:

```bash
~$ npm install
```

Start in your `Android` or `iOS` device. Here we'll using a `tns` or a `nativescript` command on the console.

```bash
~$ tns run android
...
Successfully synced application org.nativescript.Groceries on device XXXXXXXXXXX.
